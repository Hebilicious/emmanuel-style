# Draft: The Principles of Promethean Cosmism

## Introduction

Promethean Cosmism is a philosophical framework for the long-term future of intelligent life. It posits that humanity's grand purpose is to expand beyond the confines of Earth (Cosmism), and that this expansion must be achieved by actively seizing the tools of science and technology to overcome our biological limitations (Prometheanism).

It is a direct rejection of stagnation, passivity, and any ideology that would limit human potential out of fear or dogma. However, it is not a call for reckless ambition. The entire framework is built upon a foundational principle: all progress must be grounded in a rational, evidence-based understanding of realityâ€”a permanent synthesis of our philosophical goals and our scientific capabilities.

## The Promethean Mandate

The "Promethean" aspect refers to the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to empower humanity. This is a mandate to:

- **Master Technology:** Aggressively pursue and master transformative technologies, including AI, genetic engineering, and advanced energy production.
- **Transcend Biology:** View human biology not as a sacred constant, but as a starting point. The goal is to consciously guide our own evolution, overcoming aging, disease, and cognitive limitations.
- **Embrace Foresight:** Like Prometheus ("forethought"), this philosophy emphasizes rational planning and simulation to mitigate risks, rather than avoiding them through prohibition.

## The Cosmist Vision

The "Cosmist" aspect defines the ultimate direction for this Promethean energy.

- **Multi-planetary Expansion:** The belief that the long-term survival and flourishing of consciousness requires expansion into the solar system and beyond.
- **Kardashev Scale as a Metric:** It uses the Kardashev scale as a metric for civilizational progress, aiming to deliberately advance humanity to a Type I, Type II, and eventually Type III status.
- **The Universe as a Project:** It views the universe not as a static backdrop, but as a physical system that can be understood, engineered, and ultimately shaped by intelligent, reality-based action.

## The Foundational Synthesis

Promethean Cosmism is distinguished from utopianism or pure futurism by its core principle: a non-negotiable bond between ambition and evidence. It is the ideology that emerges from the intellectual framework described in the "Theory of Intellectual Cycles," representing the permanent reunion of philosophy and fundamental science. Without this grounding, Promethean ambition becomes hubris, and the Cosmist vision becomes fantasy.
